# Canvas Redesign Concept

This is a static UI concept inspired by BetterCampus for a Canvas redesign. It focuses on theming, dashboard customization, smarter to-dos, and a GPA calculator. The current version uses mock data and can be extended to integrate with the Canvas API once authentication is defined.

## Features
- Theme picker with dark mode toggle
- Customizable dashboard layout
- Assignment preview modal for to-dos
- GPA calculator (weighted + cumulative)
- Notes panel

## Run locally
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000`.
